# Urban Transit Delay Dashboard  
### Turning Lagos Bus Transit Data into Actionable Insights for Smarter Urban Mobility

##  Project Overview
The **Urban Transit Delay Dashboard** is a data analytics project designed to analyze and visualize bus transit delays within Lagos’ urban transport network. The dashboard provides decision-makers with a consolidated view of operational performance across routes, bus types, passenger volumes, and weather conditions.

By transforming raw transit data into meaningful insights, this project supports **evidence-based planning**, **service optimization**, and **improved passenger experience**.

---

##  Objectives
- Identify routes with consistently high average delay times  
- Assess the impact of weather conditions on transit delays  
- Compare delay patterns across different bus types  
- Understand passenger load distribution relative to delays  
- Enable stakeholders to prioritize interventions and resource allocation  

---

##  Key Metrics Tracked
- **Total Trips:** 2,000  
- **Total Passengers:** 77,718  
- **Average Delay Time:** 3.43 minutes  
- **Average Passenger Count per Trip:** 38.86  

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Route-Based Delay Patterns
- Routes **LAG-201 and LAG-301** show the highest average delay times (~3.5 minutes).
- Route **LAG-102** performs relatively better with lower average delays (~3.3 minutes).
- Persistent delays on specific routes suggest **structural or congestion-related issues** rather than random variability.

### 2. Weather Impact on Delays
- **Foggy (3.73 mins)** and **Rainy (3.67 mins)** conditions result in the highest average delays.
- **Sunny weather** shows comparatively lower delays (3.22 mins).
- Weather-related delays represent a predictable risk that can be proactively managed.

### 3. Bus Type Performance
- **Standard buses** record the highest number of trips and delays, reflecting heavy utilization.
- **Mini buses** show moderate delays but carry fewer passengers.
- **Articulated buses** transport more passengers per trip but appear more sensitive to severe delays when they occur.

### 4. Passenger Load vs Delay
- High passenger volumes are often associated with routes and bus types experiencing greater delays.
- This suggests a potential trade-off between **capacity utilization and service punctuality**.

##  Recommendations for Stakeholders

### 1. Route Optimization
- Conduct operational audits on **high-delay routes (LAG-201, LAG-301)** to identify bottlenecks such as traffic congestion, stop spacing, or signal delays.
- Consider route redesign or schedule adjustments during peak hours.

### 2. Weather-Responsive Scheduling
- Introduce **weather-adjusted buffer times**, especially during rainy and foggy conditions.
- Deploy real-time alerts and predictive scheduling during adverse weather to reduce passenger dissatisfaction.

### 3. Fleet Allocation Strategy
- Increase deployment of **articulated buses** on high-demand routes, paired with priority lane access to minimize delay impact.
- Use **mini buses** for feeder or low-demand routes where flexibility is critical.

### 4. Passenger Experience Improvement
- Integrate delay insights into passenger information systems to improve transparency.
- Provide real-time updates at bus stops and mobile platforms.

### 5. Data-Driven Policy & Investment
- Prioritize infrastructure investments (dedicated bus lanes, traffic signal priority) on routes with chronic delays.
- Use dashboard insights as a monitoring tool for continuous performance evaluation.
